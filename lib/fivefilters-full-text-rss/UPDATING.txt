Updating Full-Text RSS
======================

To update your copy of Full-Text RSS to ensure feeds continue to be processed as they were before, we suggest the following steps:

1. Keep your current installation in place for now (we'll deal with it later)

2. Extract this updated package to a new folder -- for example, if the last version is in a folder called 'full-text-rss', extract this version to a new folder called 'full-text-rss-updated'

3. FTP the new folder up to your server

4. Access index.php in the new folder through your browser -- for example http://example.org/full-text-rss-updated/index.php

5. Enter a URL in the form field to test the updated code

6. If you'd configured the last version, copy custom_config.php from your old version to the new folder.

7. Test the new copy again to make sure the config values are now applied to the new version.

8. Now simply rename the folder with your old copy to 'full-text-rss-old' and then rename the folder with the new copy to 'full-text-rss' (or whatever name you'd given the original folder).

That's all that's needed. Your feeds should continue to work as they did before. Let us know if you have any trouble: fivefilters@fivefilters.org.
