### Important Note

If you were running this plugin pre-2.3 and have upgraded, you need to go into the Feeder menu and click the `Switch feeds to new retrieval setup` button.

#### Project goals:

-	Retrieve items within the WordPress dashboard as an independent process (no required attachment to external servers)

-	Retrieve their full content to read from within WordPress's dashboard.

-	Allow individuals or groups to mark items for consideration and discuss them within the dashboard, either from the retrieved items or via bookmarklet.

-	Easily post about retrieved items as the end point of a smoothly integrated editorial process.

-	Provide the entire process in a attractive, responsive and mobile friendly design.

-	Provide an open source back-end that is easily extendable for other developers and that can be hooked into by other independent WordPress plugins.
